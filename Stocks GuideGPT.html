<h3>
Apple Inc.
</h3>
<p>
First up is Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world, if you exclude government-backed behemoths such as oil giant Saudi Aramco. Like other
tech stocks, AAPL shares had a rough go of it in 2022, as recession fears and soaring interest rates spooked investors in the sector. Following a rare
26.4% pullback in 2022, Apple shares have bounced back to the tune of 38.3% in 2023, recently hitting all-time highs. The $2.8 trillion iPhone maker now
trades at around 30 times earnings, reflecting the market's confidence in the company's strong competitive moat.
</p>
<p>
Apple recently unveiled its newest product, a virtual reality headset dubbed the Apple Vision Pro, which will retail for $3,499. While that price tag will
likely make it a niche product in the early days, investors are hoping some iteration of the technology will emerge as a new source of meaningful revenue
alongside product lines like the Apple Watch and the Mac.
</p>
<h3>
Dutch Bros Inc.
</h3>
<p>
While massive, established companies like Apple can offer investors some stability, smaller companies have more room for expansion and can boost portfolios.
Enter the rapidly expanding coffee chain Dutch Bros, which for comparison's sake, is roughly 0.2% the size of Apple despite being worth about $4.6 billion.
Revenue grew like a weed in 2022, surging 48.4%. With initial roots on the West Coast, Dutch Bros locations are almost entirely in the West and Southwest,
with 716 locations in 14 states through the end of March.
</p>
<p>
The small footprint of its drive-thru stores means they are relatively cheap to open, allowing for faster expansion. That shows up in the numbers: Dutch
Bros opened 133 new stores in 2022, which works out to location growth of 25%. While the company's stock got off to a hot start in 2023, shares sank in
early May after a quarterly earnings report that fell below analysts' expectations. Shares are more or less breakeven on the year through June 6.
</p>
<h3>
Citygroup Inc.
</h3>
<p>
Next up is Citigroup, a $90 billion multinational bank with both retail and investment banking arms. What Citigroup offers investors is twofold: First, it
pays a healthy 4.3% dividend yield, which is a nice buffer for shareholders in an era of rising rates and high inflation. Importantly, that dividend is
sustainable over time, with Citigroup using less than 30% of earnings to finance its payouts. Aside from its high dividend, Citigroup also looks like a
value stock at current levels, trading for less than eight times forward earnings and just 0.49 times book value. Famed investor and financial guru Warren
Buffett began buying Citigroup stock in the first quarter of 2022, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A, BRK.B) now owns a roughly $2.6 billion stake in the
company. Citigroup stock is up 6.6% in 2023 through June 6.
</p>
<h3>
Amazon.com Inc.
</h3>
<p>
Dominant internet retailer Amazon was also named one of the 10 best stocks to buy for 2023. The e-commerce giant had a miserable 2022 in which shares lost
50% of their value. The culprits included cost inflation, a tight labor market, supply chain challenges and dwindling consumer confidence. That said, the
market was far too eager to write off Amazon, whose crown jewel is Amazon Web Services, its large, fast-growing and massively profitable cloud services
arm. AWS has an annual revenue run rate of more than $85 billion. Given cloud services rival Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) trades for about 12 times sales,
putting the same multiple on AWS pegs its value at $1.02 trillion. At Amazon's roughly $1.3 trillion valuation, investors are getting the rest of the
company's massive operations – which posted 2022 sales of $434 billion – for about $280 billion. AMZN has proven to be a great pick thus far in 2023, with
shares up 50.4% through June 6.
</p>
<h3>
Walt Disney Co.
</h3>
<p>
One of the most important things to consider when selecting stocks to buy and hold for the long term is a company's management team. And with the recent
return of longtime CEO Bob Iger, Disney has that in spades. Considered one of the best CEOs this side of the millennium, Iger presided over a series of
wildly successful acquisitions – including Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm – before passing the CEO role to Bob Chapek in February 2020. Disney's
May earnings report saw the House of Mouse meeting expectations for both earnings and revenue. A recent price hike for streaming service Disney+ helped
soften the blow of a huge loss in subscribers, largely from its India platform Hotstar. DIS stock is up 6.1% this year through June 6.
